As a result of the war, a large number of top scientists were killed and various high-end facilities were destroyed, no country could continue to develop space technology. The large number of disabled people caused by the World War has also become a major factor driving the rapid development of biotechnology. Under the effect of the dual factors, the combination of machinery and flesh became the trend of social development, and most people were keen on implanting mechanical devices in their bodies, such as using high-tech mechanical eyeballs to replace the native human eyeballs, modifying the cerebral cortex so as to improve intelligence, and replacing the bones of the body to enhance human movement. 2149, after years of development of biological and mechanical adaptation, people have adapted to this way of life. The mechanical implant devices were called prostheses.","\n","ev","str","^I got it, start!","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Start"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Start":[["^You","\n","^John Wick","\n","^26 years old","\n","^Working as a data analyst at a prosthetic research company (New Humanity)","\n","^Have not had a prosthetic implant since birth","\n","^The environment is getting worse and your body can't handle it","\n","^Many diseases appear","\n","^......","\n","ev","str","^Got it!","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Part1_1"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Part1_1":[[["ev",{"^->":"Part1_1.0.0.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^\"Damn!\"",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Part1_1.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.0.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":".^.^.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["^\"What's wrong, John?\"","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Part1_1.0.g-0.2.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":18},{"s":["^\"Why have my eyes become so red?

In the city council vote, some council members abstain from voting, and the final vote is 67-67, a tie. The debate on the use of data by biotech companies is also heating up, with people on the street discussing the topic.","\n","^Not only did the city authorities have difficulty making a decision, but the public's attitude was also polarized. Some people believe that the need to monitor biotech companies has lost its original meaning because their use of data is so pervasive that it is no longer practical to stop them. At the same time, they also believe that instead of not letting biotech companies use their data, they should let go of data privacy and allow biotech companies to use their data because they believe that these biotech companies can use the data to develop new devices that will make their lives easier and faster. If possible, they don't even mind selling their biometric data in order to make a profit from it. For these people, their own personal biometric data in their hands is meaningless, to protect the privacy of these rather than superfluous, rather than so better to let the people who need to use, if you can earn money from it is a good choice. Most of these people live in poverty or have a fervent pursuit of technology, hoping to use higher and better technology to serve their own lives. Privacy is not worth much to them, such as the homeless people on the street, for whom privacy is neither a luxury nor a necessity, and whose existence is not obvious, so they do not support the bill proposed by the city council.","\n","^For another group of people, the attitude is very different. They believe that biotechnology companies must be subject to due supervision, and the supervision should not be very low, and should try to maintain transparency to the public at more than 80%, so as to better protect the privacy rights of individuals. These people believe that if biotech companies are allowed to use users' personal data as they please, they can indeed serve the public better and develop convenient and effective products. But over time, if people become numb to their privacy and no longer care about their personal data, everything will be controlled by the companies, and the products developed will no longer serve the public but will be determined by the interest of the companies, because the power of speech is no longer in the hands of the public, but by the companies. They are free to set the price of their products and to decide which rights and benefits are available to those who use them, which can be very harmful to society and the public interest, and therefore biotechnology companies should be strongly monitored.","\n","^The dispute between the two factions was so intense that it was passed from the city council to the streets of the city, and various advertisements were spread all over the city.
